# IDAPyHelper

IDAPyHelper is a plugin for the Interactive Disassembler that helps writing IDAPython scripts and plugins.

It does so by acquiring all names accessible via IDAPython and making them available as a browsable list that can be sorted, scanned (Alt-T) and filtered (Ctrl-F) arbitrarily. Double clicking a list entry opens a separate view that displays the item's docstring, if  available.
